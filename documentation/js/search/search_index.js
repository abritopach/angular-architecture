architecture is not the perfect solution for all projects.\nI have mainly followed the recommendations proposed by the Angular documentation.\nThis project is based on the following fundamentals:\n* Consistency: simplicity (for small apps) and scalability (for big apps).\n* Reusability in different projects.\n* Optimization (consistent with or without lazy-loading).\n* Testability.This project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.0.\nAlthough design is not the main objective of this project I have decided to use Angular Material.\nProject Architecture\n// TODO: Complete architecture.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
